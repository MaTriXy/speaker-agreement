# Speaker Agreement

I'm often asked how I structure the speaker agreements that formalize the contract between event organizers and myself. This repository contains the LaTeX version of my standard speaker engagement agreement.

This template is designed to be used for creating speaker agreements using LaTex. It has dynamic variables that you can change based on the event informaton (e.g., event name, venue, session start time, etc.) and static content that will always be the same (e.g., your name, mailing address, etc.).

The terms and conditions in the contract have been cobbled together from a variety of speaker agreements I have seen in the past. They are meant to provide sample content that you can modify to fit your needs. 

You'll need a LaTex client to modify and use this template. There are several open source multi-platform client options available as either desktop or online applications. I currently use (MacTeX)[http://www.tug.org/mactex/].
